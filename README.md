# 11klas Homework

This is the website I made during the last year at school.
It resembles the timetable design of the school diary.
It presents a timetable for the 11klas class and the homework assignments.
It was used by classmates to look up the homework assignments w/o having to ask the classmates.

Different groups of students have different secondary subjects.
The app allows users to switch between different subjects and 
remembers their choice in local storage.
